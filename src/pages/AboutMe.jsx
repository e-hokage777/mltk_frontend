          I loved playing games as a kid. I loved how games showed me many new,
          exciting workds. But something kept bothering me. How were these
          wonderful worlds created? How was I able to enjoy such amazing
          experiences on my screen? These questions led me to discover
          programming. And programming opened a wholel new world of
          possibilities for me. The fields that caught my eye were Web
          Development and Machine Learning. I, therefore strive to develop
          amazing websites taht make use of Machine Learning to learn patterns
          that improve user experience.
